# Quiz-Application

---

## Project Overview

---

### Project Goal

The project should allow teachers and students to interact with it in different ways. Both users will be able to create and login to accounts on the application. The teachers will be able to create questions which they can then assign to their students as quiz sets. The students will be able to solve these quiz sets and submit their results back to the respective teacher for review and marking. The application can be beneficial for remote and in-class testing.



### Definition of Done

The application will be defined as done when the minimum viable product, as laid out in the project board, has been achieved. At such a point, features of the application will come under review and any additions and alterations can be planned for future sprints.

### Sprint 1 - Tuesday 1st December 2020

---

By the end of this sprint I aimed to have a three tier application structured with a business layer, a model layer and a basic GUI. At this point I wanted to have the foundations laid down without implementing any CRUD functionality between the business and GUI layers.

#### Sprint Review

The database was completed and displayed as expected. The structure of the database had a backing ERD. Basic crud methods were created to populate the business layer. Some issues were encountered when attempting to add background images to the GUI layer and page issues took some time to resolve.

#### Sprint Retrospective

A key aim to improve productivity is the overall clarity of user stories. As visible in the two images attached to the sprint, certain acceptance criteria were edited at the end of the sprint. In the future, changes to acceptance criteria will be made before the commencement of that sprint.
