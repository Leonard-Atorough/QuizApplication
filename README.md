# Quiz-Application

---

## Project Overview

---

### Project Goal

The project should allow teachers and students to interact with it in different ways. Both users will be able to create and login to accounts on the application. The teachers will be able to create questions which they can then assign to their students as quiz sets. The students will be able to solve these quiz sets and submit their results back to the respective teacher for review and marking. The application can be beneficial for remote and in-class testing.



### Definition of Done

The application will be defined as done when the minimum viable product, as laid out in the project board, has been achieved. At such a point, features of the application will come under review and any additions and alterations can be planned for future sprints.
